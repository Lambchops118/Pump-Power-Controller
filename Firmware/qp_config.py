# --- confirmed hardware mapping (bench-confirmed 2026-07-26) ------------------
#
# The owner's original table used MicroPython GPIO numbers, not Pico physical
# header positions. This was proven after deployment with a direct script using
# Pin(9), Pin(10), Pin(11), and Pin(12): each output activated its relay when
# driven high. The fuse inputs from that same table are GP1, GP2, GP4, and GP5,
# but fuse sensing remains deliberately unavailable (see below).

# numbers never appear in an MQTT topic, payload, or action parameter.
