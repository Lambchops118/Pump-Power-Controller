# --- confirmed hardware mapping (netlist-derived 2026-08-28) ------------------
#
# Taken from the Controller_Board_mk2 netlist, which is the authoritative record
# of what the board actually routes. Each channel drives a base resistor into a
# low-side NPN switch that energizes one relay coil:
#
#     GP6 -> R1 -> Q1 -> K4 -> output J2   (fuse divider F2 -> R5 -> GP0)
#     GP7 -> R4 -> Q4 -> K3 -> output J3   (fuse divider F1 -> R6 -> GP1)
#     GP8 -> R3 -> Q3 -> K2 -> output J4   (fuse divider F3 -> R7 -> GP2)
#     GP9 -> R2 -> Q2 -> K1 -> output J5   (fuse divider F4 -> R8 -> GP3)
#
# Channels are numbered in output-connector order (J2..J5). Which pot a channel
# waters is decided by which terminal its pump is plugged into, not by firmware.
#
# This supersedes the GP9/GP10/GP11/GP12 table, which was inferred rather than
# measured (SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-07-26_QUAD_PUMP_GPIO_MAPPING.md records that no
# physical command was ever issued against it). The board marks GP10, GP11 and
# GP12 as unconnected, so channels 2-4 drove floating pins and no relay moved.
#
# Logical channel numbers 1-4 are the only identifiers used off-device. GPIO
# numbers never appear in an MQTT topic, payload, or action parameter.

# The fuse signal is an analog divider, but GP0/GP1/GP2/GP3 have no ADC — the Pico W
# exposes only GP26-GP28. Every channel therefore reports "unknown" forever and
